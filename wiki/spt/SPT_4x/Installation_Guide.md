## What you need to do before you install SPT
Verify that your retail game copy is fully up-to-date, through the official Launcher or Steam.
SPT requires that your retail game is on the latest version.

Verify that your retail game copy works, and that you can load up to at least the main menu or stash.
This is particularly important if you have just installed the game so all necessary files can be generated.

## Installing and running SPT

1. Download the [SPT Installer](https://sp-mod.com/installer).
	- The installer is only for installing SPT, it **does not** update an existing SPT install.
  - Keep the installer in your downloads folder. **Do not put it into your Live folder.**
2. Run the SPT Installer.
3. Read the Installer Info page, then click next.
 - This page contains information as to what the installer does and does not do. It also answers many common questions that users have.
4. Select a new empty folder. We recommend `C:\Games\SPT`. 
	- Do not install to a protected location such as Downloads, Desktop or Program Files.
5. Select which version of SPT you want to install.
6. Click 'Start Install' and wait for it to complete.
	- Once complete you will be asked if you want to open the Install Folder or Add a Desktop Shortcuts. Tick or untick to your preference.
	- If you decide against the shortcuts, you can run the `SPT.Server` and `SPT.Launcher` from inside your SPT folder. They are shortcuts which you can copy to any location on your computer.
7. Run `SPT.Server`.
 - Wait for the green text that says `Server has started, happy playing`.
 - Your server needs to be running while you play. It can just be closed when you are done playing.
8. Run `SPT.Launcher` and follow the onscreen instructions.
 - You can use any username you want. It is recommend that you **do not** use your retail game account username. Especially if you plan on recording or streaming SPT.
 - Select your desired game version. Each version has a description box summarising what is included. Once you have picked your chosen game version click `Register`. You can pick *any* game version you want from the profile list, you do not need to own the corresponding retail game version. Once chosen, you cannot change the edition a profile is using.
9. Click `Start Game` and load into the main menu.

Once you have completed the above, you can now play SPT and install mods found on [The Forge](https://sp-mod.com/). You can find a guide on how to correctly install SPT mods on the [Installing Mods](/SPT_4x/Installing_Mods) Wiki page.

## Common Installation and Start-up Issues

If your issue is not listed then join our [Discord Server](https://discord.sp-tushonka.com/) and ask in the [`#spt-support`](https://discord.com/channels/875684761291599922/1172730102119944222) channel.

<details>
<summary>Could not find a downgrade patcher for the version of the game you have installed.</summary>

  There is a new live game update and either the SPT Development Team needs to update the downpatcher or you have not updated your retail game copy via the official Launcher.

<details>
<summary>SPT Server crashing instantly or not opening up at all?</summary>

For SPT 4.0 see [here](/SPT_40/Known_SPT_Issues_40#server-doesnt-launch-or-closes-immediately)  
For SPT 4.1 see [here](/SPT_41/Known_SPT_Issues_41#server-doesnt-launch-or-closes-immediately)

If it tells you that you already have them installed, then use the repair option. Restart your PC after.

If that didn't help, verify that your SPT install path doesn't have any special characters (`;,[]{}` etc.).

<details>
<summary>The application had a critical error and failed to run "Watermark" error.</summary>

<img src="/failedshortcuts.png" style="border: 2px solid grey;" alt="Watermark Error">

This happens because you have moved the `SPT.Server.exe` and/or the `SPT.Launcher.exe`, out of your their folder. 
You will need to move these back into your `\SPT_Runtime` folder for SPT 4.1 or `\SPT` for SPT 4.0 and create desktop shortcuts of these. You can do this by right-clicking the executables and then Send To > Desktop (Shortcut). The shortcuts to the two are made by the installer automatically, which you can find in the root folder of your SPT install.
</details>

## Old mods and profiles
You cannot use any of your old mod files in a newer SPT version. If you want to use the same mods, you need to download updated versions of them once they have been updated to the latest SPT version.

Some old profiles can work. See the [version numbers](/SPT_4x/Updating_SPT#version-numbers) section for more details.
