{.is-info}

## Infinite loading after installing mods
This happens most often due to installing mods not made for your version of SPT.
- Outdated [**server**](/SPT_4x/Mod_Types#server-mods) mods will either flag red errors in your SPT server terminal and prevent any mods from being loaded, or not load at all.
- Outdated [**client**](/SPT_4x/Mod_Types#client-mods) mods will **not** throw errors in the SPT server terminal window and **will** allow the game to launch, but then might encounter infinite loading or other issues.

When selecting the mods you want to install, make sure that you **only install mods that have been marked compatible with [your SPT version](/SPT_4x/Updating_SPT#version-numbers)**. Mods for incompatible SPT versions will not work, and will break things. If you are unsure what version of SPT you are on, you can see the SPT version in the top left of the server window or in the bottom left while in-game.

Read the [Uninstalling Mods](/SPT_4x/Uninstalling_Mods) Wiki page to see how to remove your outdated mods.

If you verified all your mods to be compatible with your version of SPT and you still have infinite loading, then join our [Discord server](https://discord.sp-tushonka.com/) and follow the [`#support-guidelines`](https://discord.com/channels/875684761291599922/1172733248317694022) on opening a new support thread.

## BTR Driver chat instantly closes

## Raid doesn't get saved after extracting/dying
If enabled, turn off `Practice Mode` in [SVM](https://sp-mod.com/mod/236/server-value-modifier-svm)'s `Raid Settings > Raid startup settings`.
Don't use old presets in newer versions of SVM, and make sure you have the latest version of SVM.

## With [SAIN](https://sp-mod.com/mod/791/sain-solarints-ai-modifications-full-ai-combat-system-replacement) bots don't move nor react unless shot at or grenaded

## My flea prices are extreme when using [Live Flea Prices](https://sp-mod.com/mod/1131/live-flea-prices)
Those are the prices of items on the Live flea right now. You can check the Live flea [here](https://tarkov.dev/).
By default, SPT uses the base handbook price of items +/- some variance when simulating the flea.
To get "normal" flea prices:
- Wait for the Live flea prices to stabilise.
- Set `"pvePrices"` to `true` inside Live Flea Prices' config file to use the PvE Live flea prices instead.
- [Uninstall](/SPT_4x/Uninstalling_Mods) Live Flea Prices.

## Handbook gun descriptions are broken with `So descriptive`
[Uninstall](/SPT_4x/Uninstalling_Mods) [Preview Sizer](https://sp-mod.com/mod/2339/preview-sizer).

## You are "invisible" to bots
If installed, tweak [Ombarella](https://sp-mod.com/mod/2315/ombarella). If you can't tweak it to your liking, [uninstall it](/SPT_4x/Uninstalling_Mods).

## `The given key '67c5412bb032bbdb530201ba Name' was not present in the dictionary`
[Marlin MXLR](https://sp-mod.com/mod/2484/marlin-mxlr-308-me-lever-action-rifle) is incompatible with many mods, including [ODT's Item Info](https://sp-mod.com/mod/2430/odts-item-info-spt-40). You will need to either [uninstall it](/SPT_4x/Uninstalling_Mods) or any mod that conflicts with it.

## `Method not found:... ArmorDurability ...` error in server console
Update [APBS](https://sp-mod.com/mod/1594/apbs-acids-progressive-bot-system).

## Bots aren't hostile while using [SAIN](https://sp-mod.com/mod/791/sain-solarints-ai-modifications-full-ai-combat-system-replacement) after uninstalling a custom bot mod
Delete your `[game folder]\BepInEx\plugins\SAIN\Default Bot Config Values` folder. SAIN will regenerate it on game launch.

## Screen flickers black when using [DERP](https://sp-mod.com/mod/2200/dynamic-external-resolution-patch-derp)
The black flicker only occurs when using DLSS or FSR. You can avoid it by using TAA and the Sampling Downgrade slider instead.
Note that setting the same Scaling Mode in DERP's F12 settings as in your Graphics settings will effectively disable its functionality.

## Infinite loading after installing [Tarkov DLSS 4.5](https://sp-mod.com/mod/2621/tarkov-dlss-45)
Uninstall the mod, set DLSS to any preset after **Preset J**, and reinstall the mod.

## Guns gain extreme firerate with [Artem](https://sp-mod.com/mod/1023/wtt-artem) and [Borkel's Realistic NVGs](https://sp-mod.com/mod/954/borkels-realistic-night-vision-goggles-nvgs-and-t-7)
Known issue when using the Black GPNVGs from Artem. Borkel's includes an optional black texture for the vanilla item inside `[game folder]\SPT\user\mods\BRNVG_N-15Adapter\optional black GPNVG-18`.
This issue also affects bots. You will need to use a mod like [APBS](https://sp-mod.com/mod/1594/apbs-acids-progressive-bot-system) to blacklist that item from bot loadouts. The ID for the Black GPNVGs is `66326bfd46817c660d015146`.

## `Nullable object must have a value` server error with [MassivesoftWeapons](https://sp-mod.com/mod/2588/massivesoftweapons) installed

Uninstall one of them.

## Equipped mod clothing resets to default after game restart
Change `removeModItemsFromProfile` and `removeInvalidTradersFromProfile` back to `false` in `[game folder]\SPT\SPT_Data\configs\core.json`.

## `The system cannot find the file specified. File name: System.Runtime, Version=10.0.0.0`
You installed a mod made for 4.1 to your 4.0 install. Uninstall it, and install the correct version. You can download previous versions of mods in the Versions tab on the mod page.

## `An item with the same key has already been added. Key: bosswedge`

A possible incompatibility between it and another mod. Either use the [50/50 Method](<https://wiki.sp-tushonka.com/en/SPT_4x/5050-method>) or uninstall that mod.
