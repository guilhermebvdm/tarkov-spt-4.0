## After moving your SPT 4.1.x install, you get `Game check failed: Unknown error occured, please report to SPT`
[Update your SPT](/SPT_4x/Updating_SPT).

## Server doesn't launch or closes immediately
From [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0) download the latest version of **both**:
- `ASP.NET Core Runtime`
- `.NET Desktop Runtime`

If it tells you that you already have them installed, then use the repair option. Restart your PC after.

If that didn't help, verify that your SPT install path doesn't have any special characters (`;,[]{}` etc.).

## The game closes instantly when pressing Start Game

If you have BitDefender installed add SPT to the exceptions list in both the "Antivirus" as well as "Advanced Threat Defense".
Reportedly Malwarebytes and Kaspersky also has this issue.

## Game freezes, LogOutput contains `[Error  :ModulePatch] BattlEyePatch: HarmonyLib.HarmonyException: IL Compile Error (unknown location)`
If enabled, turn off `Set Game Path` in the SPT Launcher.
