Every bot squad in your raid follows a plan: a rich area to strip, a
PvP hotspot to hunt, a quest spot to visit. They work it as a team, loot
like players, upgrade their gear along the way, and head for extract when
they're done. Kill one late in the raid and his backpack tells the story
of where he's been.

Built on [Phobos](https://discord.com/channels/875684761291599922/1337131427803955200)'s foundations (MIT, with Janky's blessing - full credits below).

**👻 Ghost Mode**: far-away bots go dormant to free
your CPU while ORBIT keeps playing them. The fps gains are massive
(+45% average in my heavy-population benchmark, testers report +50 to
+100%) and the world stays alive instead of freezing. **Ghost Mode supports
ORBIT-controlled bots as well as vanilla and faction bots.** A server **web UI**
and visual **zone editor** let you target zones by floor and bot type,
or share your setup through presets.

## What a raid looks like

- A 4-man squad rolls "clean out Resort", splits the rooms, opens a
  locked door or two, and extracts once the bags are worth it.
- The squad's Rat grabs the 5k mag his Chad walked past: personalities
  decide everything.
- Scavs hold their turf; a lucky few roam the whole map.
- Gunfire behind a hill: two ghost squads settling it off-screen. Push
  the sound and the fight turns real.

## The pillars

### 👻 Ghost Mode - the fps game changer

My heavy-population Shoreline benchmark measured **+45% average fps** with
far fewer stutters; RC testers reported anywhere from **+50 to +100%** depending
on map, modlist and hardware. Ships **ON by default** - one switch in
the web UI turns it off.

Classic limiters freeze distant bots and kill the living world with
them. Ghost Mode puts only the **body** to sleep - the expensive
EFT machinery - while their behaviour continues. ORBIT-controlled ghosts
keep walking their routes and looting in real time; native bots follow
their original behaviour. When two hostile ghosts spot each other
(optic-scaled range, terrain and forests block
line of sight), the fight plays out over a real window with audible
distant gunfire matching each side's real weapons (suppressors
included), real casualties and wounded survivors. Get close while
it's still going and it escalates into an actual firefight.

Bots wake on proximity, damage, or aiming through a scope (the wake
range stretches with your magnification). Tune which bot types sleep,
whether they move and loot, and how bloody ghost fights get.

**Vanilla and faction bots can use Ghost Mode without ORBIT takeover.**
Enable their **Dormant** toggle, **Ghost movement** and **Vanilla / faction movement**.
Leave faction **Take over** toggles OFF, or keep **Vanilla xxx** checked,
to preserve their original behaviour. These bots keep their own routing
and are not influenced by ORBIT zones. ISB White Tusks always keep their
native behaviour, even with takeover enabled.

Set gunfire investigation chances by personality for ORBIT-controlled PMC
and PlayerScav squads on the Ghost Mode page. For encounters with awake bots, choose
whether to put eligible awake bots to sleep or wake the ghosts; combat and
player proximity protections still apply.

*Fika: the optional `Orbit.Fika` addon syncs ghost fight sounds and ORBIT door states. Install the same version of it
on the host (or headless) and all playing clients.*

### 🎯 Objectives and extraction

ORBIT-controlled PMC and PlayerScav squads receive goals: high-value loot
zones, kill hunts anchored on PvP hotspots, visits to EFT quest locations.
The leader takes the anchor, the others splinter to nearby loot and cover. They extract for
real reasons - enough roubles, goals completed, or the raid clock - and
they coordinate on shared exfils like the car.

### 🎒 Looting that feels human

ORBIT-controlled bots use a custom loot engine built on BSG's pickup APIs.
Per-personality value thresholds (a GigaChad ignores what a Rat treasures), realistic
search timings and animations, inside-out container draining, and
mid-raid **gear upgrades**: a bot that finds a better rifle swaps to it,
strips the good mods off his old one, and leaves it on the corpse for
you to find.

<details>
<summary>More loot details</summary>

- Value is judged per inventory slot (price ÷ size): a 50k key beats a
  bulky 60k backpack.
- Regular scavs pick things up opportunistically (dice per item) instead of
  using thresholds. PlayerScavs loot like PMCs.
- Money, fragmentation grenades and dogtags bypass value and scav chance checks,
  provided the bot has room to carry them.
- Squad memory: a Chad's "nothing good here" verdict doesn't stop the
  squad's Rat from cleaning the same container later.
- Weapon swaps are scored on ergo/recoil/range/ammo (with per-map
  weights), never on price alone, and only count ammo the bot can
  actually use.
- Rig/backpack swaps transfer the whole carry first; if one item won't
  fit, the swap is cancelled. Regular scavs never swap, they only fill empty
  slots.
- PMC corpses keep their melee; secured containers are never touched.
- Coverage rolls make squads miss a few items per room, like real
  players do.
</details>

### 🧠 Personalities run the show

ORBIT uses SAIN personalities to shape PMC behaviour: what's worth
picking up, how much of a room gets covered, who hunts and who rats, how
early they extract, whether they force locked doors, even how strong a
ghost squad fights off-screen. Two squads never play the same raid.

### 🗺️ Your raid, your rules

ORBIT's behaviour settings live in a **web UI** on your SPT server
(`/orbit`, one button away from the F12 menu), including headless setups.
Most settings apply next raid; faction takeover changes require a game
restart. Full-config export/import lets you back up or share your tuning.

**Presets:** save, switch and share settings and zones together.
Custom tuning from 2.0 is preserved as **Custom**. Editing **Default** or an
addon creates a personal copy.

<details>
<summary>Sharing addon presets</summary>

Put your exported JSON files in one folder under the server's
`user/mods/ORBIT/addon/`, for example `addon/MyPreset/config.json` and
`addon/MyPreset/zones.orbitzones.json`. Each addon folder becomes one
selectable preset; a partial preset keeps settings and maps it does not supply.

Keep that folder structure in your ZIP, and keep the **same folder and
filenames** for updates so they overwrite the previous files. Put version
numbers in the ZIP name. Updates refresh the selected addon automatically;
personal copies keep their own edits.

</details>

The **zone editor** renders each map and lets you draw the hotspots
that steer squad routing: drag, resize, attract or repel, tune BSG's
own zones, mark which ones can host kill hunts. Export your setup as a
**zone pack** and publish it on the Forge as an ORBIT addon, or import
someone else's.

Name your custom zones and target specific bot types, factions
and floors. Reserve includes floors 2 through 5; Customs includes its fourth
floor. Zones influence ORBIT-controlled bots, awake or Ghost, and still need
a reachable route to the selected area.

## Install

1. Install the dependencies: [BigBrain](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/mod/902/bigbrain) · [Waypoints](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/mod/827/waypoints-expanded-navmesh) · [SAIN](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/mod/791/sain-solarints-ai-modifications-full-ai-combat-system-replacement)
2. Extract the zip into your SPT root folder (client plugin + server mod).
3. Configure from the web UI: F12 → **Open web config UI** (or browse to
   `https://127.0.0.1:6969/orbit`).

<details>
<summary>Recommended SAIN setup (2 tweaks)</summary>

**1. Personality spread** - ORBIT was tuned around this distribution.
SAIN's config is a web UI too since 4.1: browse to
`https://127.0.0.1:6969/sain/presets` (your server address), open the
**Personalities** tab, and for each personality below set
**Can Be Randomly Assigned = On** with its **Randomly Assigned Chance**:

| Personality | Rat | Wreckless | SnappingTurtle | Coward | Chad | Timmy | GigaChad |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chance | 10 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 3 |

(Heads up for [Twitch Player](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/mod/1895/sain-twitch-players) users: it zeroes several of these by default.)

**2. Extract layer** - let ORBIT own extraction. Same UI,
**Global Settings → General → Extract**: turn **SAIN Extract Behavior** Off, then
Save (editing a built-in preset creates an editable copy).
</details>

## Compatibility

**Required**: BigBrain, Waypoints and SAIN (linked under Install above).
ORBIT uses SAIN's personality system.

**Recommended**: spawn and loadout mods shape *who* spawns with *what
gear*; ORBIT decides *where its squads go and what they do*.
[APBS](https://sp-mod.com/mod/1594/apbs-acids-progressive-bot-system), [ABPS](https://sp-mod.com/mod/2097/abps-acids-bot-placement-system), [Raid Review](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/mod/1479/raid-review).

**Do not combine with**: [QuestingBots](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/mod/1109/questing-bots), [LootingBots](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/mod/812/looting-bots), Phobos itself, or other AI limiter / culling
mods (AILimit, Adaptive Bot Culling...). Their systems overlap with ORBIT's
objectives, looting or Ghost Mode. Supported faction mods have their own
**Take over** toggles; leave them OFF to retain the author's behaviour.

## Troubleshooting

Bots frozen or acting weird? In order: check for the unsupported mods
above, test with vanilla raid times (extended raids are a known trouble
source), and if you run ABPS try regenerating its config. Still broken:
use the [50/50 method](https://wiki.sp-tarkov.com/en/5050-method), and
before reporting, reproduce with just
**ORBIT + SAIN + BigBrain + Waypoints + ABPS** on default configs (per
Shynd's classic advice: everyone's modpack is unique, shrink yours
first). Then come say hi on the [ORBIT thread](https://discord.com/channels/875684761291599922/1509314495019745451).

## Roadmap highlights

No ETA, no promises: camp & ambush decisions, post-combat self-heal,
squad splitting with radio comms, boss hunting and faction rivalries
(Firefly's idea), airdrop ambushes, a "rally flare" item that pulls the
whole map onto a point, multi-step objectives (Kiba alarm, ULTRA power,
Reserve D-2...), switch-gated and Red-Rebel-style exfils, cross-raid
player heatmaps feeding bot routing (Fiodor's idea), per-map ORBIT
and Ghost Mode settings. Suggestions land on the Discord thread.

## Known issues

- Some native or modded actions require bots to stay awake. Bosses that
  normally hold position may also remain still in Ghost.
- ORBIT can't operate extraction switches yet (for example, Reserve's D-2).
- Faction-mod takeover (RUAF / UNTAR / Black Division) can misbehave;
  leave those toggles OFF if it does. Ghost Mode can still be used.
- Labs security gates can trap bots (BSG pathing quirk, checkpoint
  tuning planned).
- Possible clash with CactusPie's auto-transfer-loot mod (bot pickups
  may land in YOUR tagged containers). Investigating.
- Bots can still occasionally get stuck on map geometry.

## About AI

Full transparency: I build ORBIT with **Claude**.

I'll be honest, I barely open an IDE these days, at work or at home:
Claude writes most of this code. I still read it, question it, and own
every design decision in it.

The ideas don't come from the AI. Neither do the evenings spent in test
raids watching bots live, digging through logs and replays, and
finetuning values until a raid finally feels right. This project eats a
LOT of personal time, and that's the part no assistant can do for me.

Without the AI, ORBIT simply wouldn't exist: a project this size doesn't
fit in one person's free time otherwise.

If that's a dealbreaker for you, no hard feelings. If you judge a mod on
what it does, give it a try.
